Controls:  
X - Hold to BOOOOOOOOOOOOST!  
C - Press to Jump.

---

Rules:  

- Pink things are all walkable.
- You can jump on crows for a bounce effect, but any other collision with them will cause you precious time (recive a penalty)
- You can boost, but if you hit a pedestrian (cyan people) you will lose all your boost and momentum!
- If you run out of time, you will lose! 
- Deliver within 10 seconds of your last delivery to unlock combo styles, such as:
	"nice!", "outstanding!", "amazing!", "awesome!" and more!


End game screen has a few seconds where you cannot skip, so be patient, save your results and post them for me!
Made in 17 hours.
